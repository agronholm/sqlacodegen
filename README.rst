This is a tool that reads the structure of an existing database and generates
the appropriate SQLAlchemy model code, using the declarative style if
possible.

This tool was written as a replacement for
`sqlautocode <http://code.google.com/p/sqlautocode/>`_, which was suffering
from several issues (including, but not limited to, incompatibility with
Python 3 and the latest SQLAlchemy version).


Features
========

* Supports SQLAlchemy 0.6.x - 1.0.x
* Produces declarative code that almost looks like it was hand written
* Produces `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant code
* Accurately determines relationships, including many-to-many, one-to-one
* Automatically detects joined table inheritance
* Excellent test coverage


Usage instructions
==================

Installation
------------

To install, do::

    pip install sqlacodegen

or, failing that::

    easy_install sqlacodegen


Example usage
-------------

At the minimum, you have to give sqlacodegen a database URL.
The URL is passed directly to SQLAlchemy's
`create_engine() <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html?highlight=create_engine#sqlalchemy.create_engine>`_
method so please refer to
`SQLAlchemy's documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html>`_
for instructions on how to construct a proper URL.

Examples::

    sqlacodegen postgresql:///some_local_db
    sqlacodegen mysql+oursql://user:password@localhost/dbname
    sqlacodegen sqlite:///database.db

To see the full list of options::

    sqlacodegen --help


Model class naming logic
------------------------

The table name (which is assumed to be in English) is converted to singular
form using the "inflect" library. Then, every underscore is removed while
transforming the next letter to upper case. For example, ``sales_invoices``
becomes ``SalesInvoice``.


Relationship detection logic
----------------------------

Relationships are detected based on existing foreign key constraints as
follows:

* **many-to-one**: a foreign key constraint exists on the table
* **one-to-one**: same as **many-to-one**, but a unique constraint exists on
  the column(s) involved
* **many-to-many**: an association table is found to exist between two tables

A table is considered an association table if it satisfies all of the
following conditions:

#. has exactly two foreign key constraints
#. all its columns are involved in said constraints


Relationship naming logic
-------------------------

Relationships are typically named based on the opposite class name.
For example, if an ``Employee`` class has a column named ``employer`` which
has a foreign key to ``Company.id``, the relationship is named ``company``.

A special case for single column many-to-one and one-to-one relationships,
however, is if the column is named like ``employer_id``. Then the
relationship is named ``employer`` due to that ``_id`` suffix.

If more than one relationship would be created with the same name, the
latter ones are appended numeric suffixes, starting from 1.
