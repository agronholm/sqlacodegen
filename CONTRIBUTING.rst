Contributing to sqlacodegen
===========================

If you wish to contribute a fix or feature to sqlacodegen, please follow the following
guidelines.

When you make a pull request against the main sqlacodegen codebase, Github runs the
sqlacodegen test suite against your modified code. Before making a pull request, you
should ensure that the modified code passes tests locally. To that end, the use of tox_
is recommended. The default tox run first runs ``pre-commit`` and then the actual test
suite. To run the checks on all environments in parallel, invoke tox with ``tox -p``.

To build the documentation, run ``tox -e docs`` which will generate a directory named
``build`` in which you may view the formatted HTML documentation.

sqlacodegen uses pre-commit_ to perform several code style/quality checks. It is
recommended to activate pre-commit_ on your local clone of the repository (using
``pre-commit install``) to ensure that your changes will pass the same checks on GitHub.

Making a pull request on Github
-------------------------------

To get your changes merged to the main codebase, you need a Github account.

#. Fork the repository (if you don't have your own fork of it yet) by navigating to the
   `main sqlacodegen repository`_ and clicking on "Fork" near the top right corner.
#. Clone the forked repository to your local machine with
   ``git clone git@github.com/yourusername/sqlacodegen``.
#. Create a branch for your pull request, like ``git checkout -b myfixname``
#. Make the desired changes to the code base.
#. Commit your changes locally. If your changes close an existing issue, add the text
   ``Fixes #XXX.`` or ``Closes #XXX.`` to the commit message (where XXX is the issue
   number).
#. Push the changeset(s) to your forked repository (``git push``)
#. Navigate to Pull requests page on the original repository (not your fork) and click
   "New pull request"
#. Click on the text "compare across forks".
#. Select your own fork as the head repository and then select the correct branch name.
#. Click on "Create pull request".

If you have trouble, consult the `pull request making guide`_ on opensource.com.
