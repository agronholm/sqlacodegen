Version history
===============

**3.0.0rc2**

- Added support for generating SQLModel classes (PR by Andrii Khirilov)
- Fixed code generation when a single-column index is unique or does not match the
  dialect's naming convention (PR by Leonardus Chen)
- Fixed another problem where sequence schemas were not properly separated from the
  sequence name
- Fixed invalid generated primary/secondaryjoin expressions in self-referential
  many-to-many relationships by using lambdas instead of strings
- Fixed ``AttributeError`` when the declarative generator encounters a table name
  already in singular form when ``--option use_inflect`` is enabled
- Increased minimum SQLAlchemy version to 1.4.36 to address issues with ``ForeignKey``
  and indexes, and to eliminate the PostgreSQL UUID column type annotation hack

**3.0.0rc1**

- Migrated all packaging/testing configuration to ``pyproject.toml``
- Fixed unwarranted ``ForeignKey`` declarations appearing in column attributes when
  there are named, single column foreign key constraints (PR by Leonardus Chen)
. Fixed ``KeyError`` when rendering an index without any columns
- Fixed improper handling of schema prefixes in sequence names in server defaults
- Fixed identically named tables from different schemas resulting in invalid generated
  code
- Fixed imports caused by ``server_default`` conflicting with class attribute names
- Worked around PostgreSQL UUID columns getting ``Any`` as the type annotation

**3.0.0b3**

- Dropped support for Python < 3.7
- Dropped support for SQLAlchemy 1.3
- Added a ``__main__`` module which can be used as an alternate entry point to the CLI
- Added detection for sequence use in column defaults on PostgreSQL
- Fixed ``sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`` when encountering a column named
  "metadata" (regression from 2.0)
- Fixed missing ``MetaData`` import with ``DeclarativeGenerator`` when only plain tables
  are generated
- Fixed invalid data classes being generated due to some relationships having been
  rendered without a default value
- Improved translation of column names into column attributes where the column name has
  whitespace at the beginning or end
- Modified constraint and index rendering to add them explicitly instead of using
  shortcuts like ``unique=True``, ``index=True`` or ``primary=True`` when the constraint
  or index has a name that does not match the default naming convention

**3.0.0b2**

- Fixed ``IDENTITY`` columns not rendering properly when they are part of the primary
  key

**3.0.0b1**

**NOTE**: Both the API and the command line interface have been refactored in a
backwards incompatible fashion. Notably several command line options have been moved to
specific generators and are no longer visible from ``sqlacodegen --help``. Their
replacement are documented in the README.

- Dropped support for Python < 3.6
- Added support for Python 3.10
- Added support for SQLAlchemy 1.4
- Added support for bidirectional relationships (use ``--option nobidi``) to disable
- Added support for multiple schemas via ``--schemas``
- Added support for ``IDENTITY`` columns
- Disabled inflection during table/relationship name generation by default
  (use ``--option use_inflect`` to re-enable)
- Refactored the old ``CodeGenerator`` class into separate generator classes, selectable
  via ``--generator``
- Refactored several command line options into generator specific options:

  - ``--noindexes`` → ``--option noindexes``
  - ``--noconstraints`` → ``--option noconstraints``
  - ``--nocomments`` → ``--option nocomments``
  - ``--nojoined`` → ``--option nojoined`` (``declarative`` and ``dataclass`` generators
    only)
  - ``--noinflect`` → (now the default; use ``--option use_inflect`` instead)
    (``declarative`` and ``dataclass`` generators only)
- Fixed missing import for ``JSONB`` ``astext_type`` argument
- Fixed generated column or relationship names colliding with imports or each other
- Fixed ``CompileError`` when encountering server defaults that contain colons (``:``)

  (fixes #30)
