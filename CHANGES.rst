Version history
===============

**UNRELEASED**

- Fixed ``sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`` when encountering a column named "metadata"
  (regression from 2.0)

**3.0.0b2**

- Fixed ``IDENTITY`` columns not rendering properly when they are part of the primary key

**3.0.0b1**

**NOTE**: Both the API and the command line interface have been refactored in a backwards
incompatible fashion. Notably several command line options have been moved to specific generators
and are no longer visible from ``sqlacodegen --help``. Their replacement are documented in the
README.

- Dropped support for Python < 3.6
- Added support for Python 3.10
- Added support for SQLAlchemy 1.4
- Added support for bidirectional relationships (use ``--option nobidi``) to disable
- Added support for multiple schemas via ``--schemas``
- Added support for ``IDENTITY`` columns
- Disabled inflection during table/relationship name generation by default
  (use ``--option use_inflect`` to re-enable)
- Refactored the old ``CodeGenerator`` class into separate generator classes, selectable via
  ``--generator``
- Refactored several command line options into generator specific options:

  - ``--noindexes`` → ``--option noindexes``
  - ``--noconstraints`` → ``--option noconstraints``
  - ``--nocomments`` → ``--option nocomments``
  - ``--nojoined`` → ``--option nojoined`` (``declarative`` and ``dataclass`` generators only)
  - ``--noinflect`` → (now the default; use ``--option use_inflect`` instead)
    (``declarative`` and ``dataclass`` generators only)
- Fixed missing import for ``JSONB`` ``astext_type`` argument
- Fixed generated column or relationship names colliding with imports or each other
- Fixed ``CompileError`` when encountering server defaults that contain colons (``:``)
